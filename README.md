# AI Reusable Components

A collection of production-ready, modular AI components designed to accelerate the development of intelligent applications. This repository provides a comprehensive suite of pre-built components that handle common AI workflows, from document processing to content generation.

## Overview

This repository contains containerized, API-driven components that can be easily integrated into your AI applications. Each component is designed with scalability, reliability, and ease of use in mind, allowing developers to focus on building innovative solutions rather than implementing foundational AI capabilities from scratch.

## Available Components

### Document Processing
- **PDF Parser** - Extract text, tables, and metadata from PDF documents with high accuracy
- **OCR Engine** - Convert images and scanned documents to machine-readable text

### Text Analytics
- **Summarization** - Generate concise summaries from long-form text content
- **Content Tagging** - Automatically extract and assign relevant tags to text

### Generation & Enhancement
- **Text Generation** - Generate human-like text for various use cases
- **Content Rewriting** - Improve clarity, style, and readability of existing text
- **Translation** - Multi-language translation with context awareness

## Key Features

- **Containerized Deployment** - Each component runs in its own Docker container for easy deployment and scaling
- **RESTful APIs** - Simple HTTP interfaces for seamless integration
- **Configuration Management** - Environment-based configuration for different deployment scenarios
- **Health Monitoring** - Built-in health checks and monitoring endpoints
- **Scalable Architecture** - Designed to handle high-throughput production workloads
- **Language Agnostic** - Components can be integrated with applications written in any programming language

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-components
   ```

2. **Choose your components**
   ```bash
   # Start individual components
   docker-compose up summarization-service
   docker-compose up pdf-parser-service
   ```

3. **Use the APIs**
   ```bash
   # Example: Summarize text
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/summarize \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Your long text here..."}'
   ```

## Architecture

Each component follows a consistent architectural pattern:
- **Service Layer** - Core AI/ML processing logic
- **API Layer** - RESTful interface with request/response validation
- **Configuration** - Environment-based settings and model parameters
- **Health Checks** - Monitoring and diagnostic endpoints

## Use Cases

- **Document Management Systems** - Automated document processing and indexing
- **Content Management** - Intelligent content creation and optimization
- **Knowledge Bases** - Semantic search and information retrieval
- **Customer Support** - Automated ticket classification and response generation
- **Research Platforms** - Large-scale text analysis and insight extraction
- **E-commerce** - Product description generation and content enhancement
