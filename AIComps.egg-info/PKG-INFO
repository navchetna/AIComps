# AI Reusable Components

Production‑ready, modular AI components to accelerate document and text processing workflows. This monorepo organizes components by layers (input handling, model serving, tasks/services, reusable comps, and models) and provides containerized, API‑driven building blocks you can assemble into end‑to‑end applications.

## Requirements

- Docker (for containerized runs)
- Python 3.10+

## What's Inside

| Layer | Purpose | Notes | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Input Handlers](input-handlers/README.md) | Ingest and prepare inputs (PDFs, web pages) | PDF parsing client + viewer tooling | [README](input-handlers/README.md) |
| [Model Serving](model-serving/README.md) | LLM and model inference services | Serving engines: Groq, vLLM, Ollama | [README](model-serving/README.md) |
| [Tasks/Services](tasks/README.md) | Domain tasks (dataprep, retrievers, summarization, tagging) | Each task has its own Dockerfile/requirements | [README](tasks/README.md) |
| [Reusable Comps](comps/README.md) | Standalone microservices/utilities (e.g., vector store) | K8s manifests and Dockerfiles included | [README](comps/README.md) |

Here's what each of the layers include, with links to the relevant READMEs.

---
## Installation

To use these components as a package in your projects, install AIComps in editable mode:

```bash
cd AIComps/
uv pip install -e .
```

After installation, you can navigate into any of the layers (input-handlers, model-serving, tasks, comps) and follow their respective READMEs for detailed usage instructions and setup.

## [Input Handlers](input-handlers/README.md)

| Component | Description | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDF Parser | Client utilities to call a PDF parsing backend | [README](input-handlers/pdf/parser/README.md) |
| PDF Viewer | A tool to visualize parsed content with RBAC enforcement | [README](input-handlers/pdf/viewer/README.md) |
| Web Crawler | Crawl web content to feed downstream tasks | - |

---

## [Model Serving](model-serving/README.md)

| Service | Description | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Groq | Lightweight HTTP service for LLM inference via Groq | [README](model-serving/groq/README.md) |
| vLLM | A **high-throughput** framework designed for LLM inference and serving | [README](model-serving/vLLM/README.md) |
| Ollama | Open-source platform designed to run large language models **locally** | [README](model-serving/ollama/README.md) |

---

## [Tasks / Services](tasks/README.md)

These are microservices for common RAG/text workflows. Each subfolder contains `Dockerfile`, `requirements`, and a runnable entrypoint in `src/`.
